# Push Notifications Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive push notification support to the RawLens app with intelligent toggles and user-friendly permission handling.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/hooks/usePushNotifications.js` - Custom hook for push notification logic
2. `src/components/PushPermissionModal.jsx` - Modal for permission instructions
3. `src/components/PushNotificationPrompt.jsx` - Post-migration prompt for existing users

### Modified Files:
1. `src/pages/user/Profile.jsx` - Enhanced with push notification toggles and prompt

## Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Push Notification Toggle (Profile.jsx)
- **Browser Support Detection**: Automatically detects if push notifications are supported
- **Permission State Awareness**: Shows different UI based on permission status:
  - ‚úÖ Granted: Normal toggle behavior
  - ‚è≥ Default: Triggers permission request
  - üö´ Denied: Shows modal with browser-specific instructions
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows permission status and loading states
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all edge cases

#### Toggle Behavior:
- **Turning ON**:
  - If permission is "granted" ‚Üí Updates `user_settings.push_notifications = true` and calls `registerPushForUser()`
  - If permission is "default" ‚Üí Requests permission, then registers if granted
  - If permission is "denied" ‚Üí Shows instruction modal
- **Turning OFF**:
  - Updates `user_settings.push_notifications = false`
  - Deactivates all user FCM tokens (`is_active = false`)

### 2. Post-Migration Prompt (PushNotificationPrompt.jsx)
- **Smart Display Logic**: Only shows to users who haven't set a push preference
- **Dismissal Tracking**: Uses localStorage to avoid re-showing dismissed prompts
- **Benefits Communication**: Clearly explains value proposition
- **Permission Flow Integration**: Handles the full permission request flow

#### Display Conditions:
- User has `push_notifications = null/undefined` in settings
- User hasn't dismissed the prompt before
- Browser supports push notifications

### 3. Permission Modal (PushPermissionModal.jsx)
- **Browser-Specific Instructions**: Provides targeted help for Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Visual Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for enabling notifications
- **Retry Mechanism**: Allows users to try again after following instructions

### 4. Custom Hook (usePushNotifications.js)
- **Centralized Logic**: All push notification logic in one reusable hook
- **Permission Management**: Handles permission requests and status tracking
- **Token Management**: Manages FCM token registration and deactivation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed feedback

## Usage Instructions

### Integration Steps:
1. Import the hook and components in your Profile component ‚úÖ (Already done)
2. Add the push notification state management ‚úÖ (Already done)
3. Enhance the toggle handler for push notifications ‚úÖ (Already done)
4. Add the post-migration prompt to the profile page ‚úÖ (Already done)
5. Include the permission modal ‚úÖ (Already done)

### User Experience Flow:

#### First-Time Users:
1. User sees post-migration prompt explaining benefits
2. User clicks "Enable Notifications"
3. Browser requests permission
4. If granted: Token saved, settings updated
5. If denied: Modal shows instructions

#### Existing Users with Permission Denied:
1. User toggles push notifications ON
2. Modal appears with browser-specific instructions
3. User follows instructions and clicks "Try Again"
4. System re-checks permission and proceeds accordingly

#### Settings Management:
- Toggle reflects current `user_settings.push_notifications` value
- Visual indicators show browser support and permission status
- Loading states provide feedback during async operations

## Technical Details

### State Management:
- Uses existing `useSettingsStore` for persistence
- Local state for UI interactions and modals
- Permission state tracked in real-time

### Error Handling:
- Network errors handled gracefully
- Permission denials guided with instructions
- Unsupported browsers handled with clear messaging

### Performance:
- Lazy loading of permission checks
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Cleanup of event listeners and timeouts

### Browser Support:
- Chrome: Full support with specific instructions
- Firefox: Full support with specific instructions  
- Safari: Full support with specific instructions
- Edge: Full support with generic instructions
- Others: Graceful degradation with generic instructions

## Database Schema Requirements

Ensure your Supabase tables have the following structure:

### user_settings table:
```sql
- user_id (uuid, foreign key)
- push_notifications (boolean, nullable)
- email_notifications (boolean)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

### user_fcm_tokens table:
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, foreign key)
- fcm_token (text, unique)
- platform (text) -- 'web', 'ios', 'android'
- device_info (jsonb)
- is_active (boolean)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Toggle ON with granted permission
- [ ] Toggle ON with default permission (first time)
- [ ] Toggle ON with denied permission
- [ ] Toggle OFF
- [ ] Post-migration prompt shows for new users
- [ ] Post-migration prompt doesn't show after dismissal
- [ ] Permission modal shows correct browser instructions
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Unsupported browser handling

### Browser Testing:
- [ ] Chrome desktop
- [ ] Firefox desktop  
- [ ] Safari desktop
- [ ] Edge desktop
- [ ] Mobile browsers (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Push notifications not supported"**
   - Check if running on HTTPS (required for push notifications)
   - Verify browser compatibility

2. **Permission modal doesn't show**
   - Check if `pushPermission` state is properly tracked
   - Verify modal trigger conditions

3. **FCM token not saving**
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify `user_fcm_tokens` table structure
   - Check Firebase configuration

4. **Prompt shows repeatedly**
   - Check localStorage key uniqueness
   - Verify dismissal logic

### Debug Logs:
The implementation includes comprehensive console logging:
- `‚úÖ` Success operations
- `‚ùå` Error operations  
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` Warning conditions

Look for these in the browser console for debugging.
